# Python-Automation-Basics
Some of my basic projects on python automation 

1.Automated Battery Notification: provides a notification on your pc when it changes battery at the certain change you have provided(e.g. your input is 5 so after every decrease of battery by 5 percent will give out a notification) Works vise-versa too.


2.Automated Weather: in the input you will enter the city whose weather you want to check and will give out weather information such as temperatrure,weather summary(e.g.mist,fog),sunrise and sunset time.

I have submitted the results in the form of image screenshots as they came on my computer. Additionally, I have also included both the Jupyter Notebook code and its equivalent in the .py file format.
