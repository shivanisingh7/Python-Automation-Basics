# Python-Automation-Basics
Some of my basic projects on python automation 

1.Automated Battery Notification: provides a notification on your pc when it changes battery at the certain change you have provided(e.g. your input is 5 so after every decrease of battery by 5 percent will give out a notification).

2.Automated Weather: in the input you will enter the city whose weather you want to check and will give out weather information such as temperatrure,weather summary(e.g.mist,fog),sunrise and sunset time.
